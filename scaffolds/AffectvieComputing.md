Based on the facts that computers were beginning to acquire the ability to express and recognize affect, and may soon be given the ability to "have emotions." According recent neurological studies, emotion plays the essential role both in assisting humans with better performance and enhance the computers' ability of decision making. In this paper, [R. W. Picard](https://web.media.mit.edu/~picard/)，a compter scientist from MIT, presents and discusses key issues in "[affective computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing)", computing that relates to , arises from, or influences emotions.

The study about mathine and affect track back to the very first day of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) was mentioned in Dartmouth AI summer conference. The official concept of affective computing was discussed in this paper.

$\underline{\text{01. Fear, Emotion, and Science}}$

>Traditionally, emotions are believed to be inherently non-scientific, and have the stigma in science for quite a long time.

>Instead of pursuing computerized cingulotomies or building "emotional computers", in this paper, author defined important issues in affective computing, and suggested models for affect recognition and present her ideas for new applications of affective computing to computer-assisted learning, perceptual information retrival, arts and entertainment, and human health and interaction.

### 1.1 Songs and laws

>In actual world, a lot of people konws that it is the emotion do have greatest impact/exert the greatest influence on people instead of law. Such as the politicians, who spent a bunch of money on tv ads/online ads, which will be recommended according to people's persona.

>Laws and rules are not the most important part in human behavior, in most of cases, certain culture or social environment do have a stronger constrain for people.

### 1.2 Limbic Perception

>Author discussed a special psychological phenomenon- synesthetic experiences. According to neurologist Cytowic's study, the limbic system plays a centrla role in sensory perception.

>The discovery of limbic system role in perception, and of substantially more connections from the limbic system to the cortex, suggests that the limbic influence may be the greater.

>In short, some neurophysiological studies indicates the facts that in some way, the influence of emotion is greater than objective reason.

### 1.3 Thinking-feeling axis

>The limbic system is considered to be antithetical to thinking. The popular [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator), has "thinking vs. feeling" as two endpoints of one of its axes for qualifying personality.

#### 1.3.1 Nonlimbic emotion and decision making

>The limbic brain is not the only part of the barin engaged in the experience of emotion. According to neurologist Damasio's book *Descartes' Error*, there are several non-limbic regions which affect emotion, adn suprisely, its role in reason.

>In common sense, too much emtion can wreck havoc on reasoning, but less known is the recent evidence that *too* little emotion can also wreck havoc. 

>There is no pure reason, emotions are vital for us to function as rational decision-making human beings. Damasio's theory is that emotion plays a biasing role in decision-making. One might say emtion wards off an infinite logical search. How do you decide how to proceed given scientific evidence? There is not time to consider *every possible* logical path. 

>The neurological evidence indicates emtions are not luxury; they are essential for rational human performance. Belief in "pure reason" is a logical howler.

#### 1.3.2 The Turing test

>As is known to every compuer scientist or engineer, the Turing test must not be strange. It is a theoretical test model for the judgement of a machine's intelligence.

>Although the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is designed to take place communicating only via text, so that sensory expression(e.g., voice intonation and facial expression) does not play a role, emotions can still be perceived in text, adn can still be elicited by its content and form. Clearly, a machine will not pass the Turing test unless it is also capable of perceiving and expressing emotions.

### The effective piano teacher

>The piano-teaching system is one of the interests in the Media Lab OF MIT, in paticular, systems that can grade some aspects of a student's expressive timing, dynamics, phasing, etc. 

#### Quintessential emotional experience

>Dr. Barry Kort, a mentor of children exploring and constructing scientific worlds on the MUSE and a volunteer for nearly a decade in the Discovery Room of Boston Museum of Science, says that learning is the quintessential emotional experience.

>Enthusiasm is contagious in learning. The teacher who expresses excitement about the subject matter can often stir up similiar feelings in student.

>Computer teaching and learning system abound, with interface agents perhaps provideing the most active research area for computer learning. Interface agents are expected to be able to learn our preferences, much like a trusted assistant.

>It is important to observe not just someone's emotional expression, but also their emotional state. And clearly, there are ways to discern emotion - through voice, facial expression, and other aspects of our so-called body language.


$\underline{\text{02. Sentic Modulation}}$

### 2.1 Poker face, poker body?

>The level of control involved in perfecting one's "poker face" is praised by society. But, can we perfect a "poker body?" Although debate persists about the nature of the coupling between emotion and physiological response, most writers accept a physiological component in their definitions of emotion.

>[Manfred Edward Clynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Clynes) exploits the physiological component of emotion supremely in the provocative book, *Sentics*. He formulates seven principles for sentic(emotion) communication, which pertain to "entic states," a description given by Clynes to emotional states, largely to avoid the negative connotations associated with "emotional."

### 2.2 Visceral and cognitive emotions

>The debate: "Precisely what are the cognitive, physical, and other aspects of emtion?" remains unanswered by laboratory studies. Attempts to understand the components of emotion and its generation are complicated by many factors, one of which concerns the problem of describing emotions. Wallbott and Scherer emphasize the problems in attaching adjectives to emotions, as well as the well-known problems of interference due to social pressures and expectations, such as the social "display rules" found by the psychologist Ekman, in his studies of facial expression.

>Humans are frequently conscious of their emotions, and we kown from experience and laboratory study that cognitive assessment can precede the generation of emotions; consequently, some have argued that cognitive appraisal is a necessary precondition for affective arousal. However, this view is refuted by the large aount of emprical evidence that affect can also be aroused without cognitive appraisal.


#### 2.2.1 No one can read your mind

>It is hard to know exactly what's in one's mind, for so far there is no proper method to detect and measure the cognitive influence. However, the physiological response is measureable and can be detected with several different approaches.

>Leidelmeijer discusses the evidence both for and against universal autonomic patterning. One of the outstanding problem is that sometimes different individuals exhibit different physiological responses to the same emotional state.

>The core problem in emotion recognition comes to the individual difference in the certain context. If there are consistent patterns can be discovered in underlying sentic state from observation, then the computer can aquire the information about that for identifying automatic emotional response conditioned on perceivable non-emotional factors.

#### 2.2.2 Emotional experience, expression, and state

>This part, author define the exact term of emotional experience, expression, and state. When use *sentic state*, *emotional state*, *affective state*, these terms are considered to be characterize dynamic state interchangeably as one experience an emotion. All you consciously perceive in such a state is refered to as your emotional *experience*. When you reveal, either voluntarily or not, is your emotional *expression*, or "symptoms" in Mandler's quote.  

#### 2.2.3 "Get that look off your face"

>Facial expressions are one of the two most widely ackownledged forms of sentic modulation. Related works about how to define and formulate the muscles movements and emotional state can refer to [Duchenne de Boulonge](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Duchenne-de-Boulogne), and [Paul Ekman](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BF%9D%E7%BD%97%C2%B7%E8%89%BE%E5%85%8B%E6%9B%BC)'s works.

>Emotional-modeled faces can be used to give computers graphical faces which mimic these precise expressions identified by Ekman, making the computer faces seem more human.

#### 2.2.4 It's not what she said, but how she said it

>The second widely acknowledged form of sentic modulation is in voice. You can hear love in her voice, anxiety in his. Vocal emotions can be understood by young children before they can understand what is being said and by dogs, who we assume can't understand what is being said.

>In conclusion, the spoken communication is greater than words spoken. That is also the reason voice communication needs more strong brandth fundamental equipement.


#### 2.2.5 Beyond face and voice

>There are more different kinds of sentic modulation, and related works have been done by Clynes in his research. The motor output explored most carefully by Clynes is the transient pressure of a finger during voluntary sentic expression. This finger pressure has been measured for thousands of people, and found not only to be repeatable, but to reveal distinct traces of "essentic form" for states such as no emotion, anger, hate, grief, love, joy, sex, and reverence.

*Potential available physiological responses:*
- heart rate
- diastolic and systolic blood pressure
- pulse
- pupillary dilation
- respiration
- skin conductance 
- temperature


#### 2.2.6 Sentic hotline 

>Although we can not observe directly what someone feels, and they may try to persuade us to believe they are feeling a certain way, we are not easily deceived.

>From sentic states to motor system response, the path seems to be consfusing. We are usually able to tell if someone is faking the smile.

#### 2.2.7 Inducement of sentic states

>When it comes to the inducment of emotional states, things are getting complicated. In most of cases, researchers would use some multimedia content for the inducement of emtional states. Certainly, we enjoy picking a stimulus such as music that will affect our mood in a particular way.  We tend to believe that we are also free to choose our response to the stimulus.

>A number of theorists have postulated that sensory feedback from muscle movements(such as facial) is sufficient to induce a corresponding emotion.

### 2.3 Sentic state pattern recognition

>Thus, I may speak of "recognizing emotions" but this should be interpreted as "measuring observations of motor system behavior that correspond with high probability to an underlying emotion or combination of emotion."

#### 2.3.1 Basic or prototype emotions

>In the study of finding the very prototypes of emotions, a lot of different kinds theories have been developed. After decedes' development, the most popular theory is from Ekman, indicating that there are six basic emotions for all humankind, which is : happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust.

#### 2.3.2 Affective state models

>The discrete, hidden paradigm for sentic states suggests a number of possible models. 

![隐马可夫状态转换模型](https://gimg2.baidu.com/image_search/src=http%3A%2F%2Fimages2015.cnblogs.com%2Fblog%2F1203675%2F201707%2F1203675-20170724193338403-62484481.png&refer=http%3A%2F%2Fimages2015.cnblogs.com&app=2002&size=f9999,10000&q=a80&n=0&g=0n&fmt=auto?sec=1659860714&t=e2c34bec07d09aad3742580858c73835)

>Just like the above HMM model shows, different HMM's can be trained for diferent contexts or situations- hence, the probabilities and states may vary depending on whether you are at home or work, with kids, your boss, or by yourself.

>Given one of these state-space or dimension-space models, trained on individual motor outputs, then features of unknown motor outputs can be collected in time, and used with tools such as maximum a posterior dcision-making to recognize a new unclassified emotion.

#### 2.3.3 Cathexis in computing

>[Werbos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Werbos) writes that his original inspiration for the backpropagation algorithm, extensively used in training aritificial neural networks, came from trying to mathematically translate an idea of Freud. [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud)'s Model began with the idea that human behavior is governed by emotions, adn people attach cathexis(emotional energy) to things Freud called "objects."

>There have also been computational models of emtion proposed that do not involve emotion recognition per se, but rather aim to mimic the machanisms by which emotions might be produced, for use in artificial intelligence systems.

$\underline{\text{03. Things better left unexplored?}}$

>It is better to be feared, or to be respected? We should focus on the scientific research for better understanding instead of judging the task with certain morals.

### 3.1 Computers that kill

>It's too late. Actually, computer itself was invented and built for war purpose.

#### 3.1.1 A delimma

>Express emotionally, or act emotionally?

**Question:**
>Can we create computers that will recognize and express affect, exhibit humor and creativity, and never bring about harm by emotional actions?

### 3.2 Unemotional, but affective computers

>Following metrix is showing the computer with two dimensions: perceive affect or not, express affect or not.


|  Computer   | Cannot express  |can express  |
|  ----  | :----:  | :----:  |
| cannot peceive  | I. | II. |
| can peceive | III | IV. |


#### 3.2.1 Four cases

>Giving examples for the four types of computers.

### 3.3 Affective symmetry

>When we try to be perceived, we tend to be informed simutaneously.


$\underline{\text{04. Affective Media}}$

>Author suggested several senarios for the applications of affective computing.

### 4.1 Entertainment

>Sporting events? Party? After party?

### 4.2 Expression

>Musical Turing test?

#### 4.2.1 Expressive mail

>???????
>It seems that in China, Email is only used in very formal situation and usually just for confirmation or record.

### 4.3 Film/Video

>Clynes suggest that the purer the underlying essentic form, the more powerful its ability to perusade.

#### 4.3.1 Skip ahead to the interesting part

>Author introduced some researches they do for assisting handling videos or films. 

### 4.4 Environments

>Hooper identified three kinds of responses to architecture, which I think hold true for all environments: (1) cognitive and perceptual - "hear/see" (2) symbolic and inferential - "think/know" (3) affective and evaluative - "feel/like." Perceptual and cognitive computing have been largely concerened with measuring information in the first and second catergories.

### 4.5 Aesthetic pleasure

>Subjects are divided into art and science. But artistic phenomena is a kind of human social behavior which is able to be undertood.

>Affect plays a primary role in those activities.

#### 4.5.1 Hidden forms

>There is a lot of things to be done for the understanding of art. 

#### 4.5.2 Personal taste

>It all about personal taste! Even in scientific research!

#### 4.5.3 design

>insight? creativity?

### 4.6 Affective wearable computers

>Multi-dimensional data collection for human-computer interaction.

#### 4.6.1 Implication for emotion theory

>In some ways, one might even say it is stuck.

$\underline{\text{05. Summary}}$

>Without emotion, computers are not likely to attain creative and intelligent behavior, but with too much emotion, we, the maker, may be eliminated by our creation.
