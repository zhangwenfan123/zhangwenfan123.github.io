$\underline{\text{01. INTRODUCTION}}$

>Researchers int the last decade have obtained dozens of scientific findings illuminating important roles of emotion in intelligent human functioning, even when it looks like a person is showing no emotion. These findings have reshaped scientific understanding of emotional mechanisms might be more valuable than previously believed.

>Consequently, a number of researchers have changed ahead with building machines that have several affective abilities, especially: recognizing, expressing, modelling, communicating, and responding to emotion. And, within these aeas, anumber of new criticisms and challenges have arisen. The rest of this paper addresses such matters.

$\underline{\text{02. SENSING AND RECOGNIZING EMOTION}}$

- *Criticism 1: The range of means and modalities of emotion expression is so broad, with many of these modalities being inaccessible (e.g., blood chemistry, brain activity, neurotransmitters), any others being too non-differentiated. This masks it unlikely that collecting the necessary data will be possible or feasible in the near future.*

- *Criticism 2: People's expression of emotion is so idiosyncratic and variable, that there is little hope of accurately recognizing an individual's emotional state from the available data.*

>With wearable computers, Picard's team do did a lot of researched for emotion recognition: collecting and trainning data for the eight emotion classifier. It seems a little hard for both emotion recognition accuracy and emotion characterization. 

>*On one hand, a word is dscrete, and you can usually know if you recognized it correctly or not. However, emotions can be thought of as both discrete and continuous, it is hard sometimes to know how to describe them.*

>**The key problem is very obvious that if a good measurement of affect can be developed.**

>There is an old saying in the business world: if you can't measure you can't manage it. Affect, like weather, is hard to measure; and like weather, it probably can't be predicted or controlled with perfect reliability.

$\underline{\text{03. AFFECT MODELING}}$

- *Criticism 3:*

*Little real progress has been made with cognitive modeling. How can we hope to make progress in modeling the much more subtle, multi-modal, and idosyncratic processes that characterize emotional response.*

*While some data exist regarding the effects of emotion on decision making and behavior, the majority of these data were collected in highly artificial lab environments, and both their robustness and their generalizability is questionable. IN addition, within the emotion research community, much desgreement exists regarding the types of mechanisms that mediate the effects of emotions, to the extent that attempts have even been made to characterize these mechanisms.*

*Existing models of emotion use highly stylized stereotypes of personality types and emotional responsiveness, which do not correspond to real behavior in real people.*

*The role of situational factors in emotion expression is poorly understand.*

*Together, these factors make it unlikely that any valid models of emotional processing will be constructed in the near future.*

>Just like what happenned in machine vision community, trying to build computational system that does not exactly follow nature's machanism, is sometimes very useful.

$\underline{\text{04. EMOTION EXPRESSION}}$

- *Criticism 4: The sine qua non of emotion expression is the physical body. To the extent that computers do not have physical bodies, they cannot reliably and believably express emotion. Existing attempts at expressing emotions in robots, which are at times referred to as embodied, are unrealistic and therefore unconvincing, and unable to generate the type of affective responsiveness characterizing human-human interaction.*

>The real issue is a much harder one: how to get machines to express emotion in an apropriate way?

$\underline{\text{05. ETHICS}}$

- *Criticism 5: Emotions, perhaps more so than thoughts, are ultimately personal and private.*

>Humans are doning these things to each others all the time. Sometimes, it just more unecceptable for humans' interacting with machines. 

$\underline{\text{06. UTILITY OF CONSIDERING AFFECT IN HCI}}$

- *Criticism 6: Airplanes do not flap their wings. There is not need to contanminate purely logical computers with emotional reactiveness.*

>Emotion itself plays vital role in many background processes: perception, decision-making, creativity, empathic understanding, memory, as well as in social interaction.

>Affective computing has always emphasized the need for a balance.
